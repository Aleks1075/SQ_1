# Test Strategy Document - Todo App

## Project Overview

A TypeScript/MongoDB-based todo list application implementing CRUD operations, task categorization, and deadline management.

---

## Test Strategy Components

### Unit Tests

- **Framework**: Jest
- **Location**: `src/tests/unit/UnitTests.ts`
- **Coverage**: 5 core tests addressing key questions:
  - Task creation validation
  - Task completion state management
  - Deadline validation
  - Timestamp maintenance
  - Update operation consistency

### Integration Tests

- **Framework**: Jest with MongoDB
- **Location**: `src/tests/integration/IntegrationTests.ts`
- **Coverage**: 2 comprehensive tests:
  - Task persistence verification
  - Task update persistence

### Specification Tests

- **Location**: `src/tests/specification/SpecificationTests.ts`
- **Coverage**: Business rule validation:
  - Deadline validation
  - Task state consistency
  - Category validation rules

### Mutation Tests

- **Framework**: Stryker
- **Results**: 24.71% mutation score
- **Analysis**:
  - `TaskFacade.ts`: 72.97% (best coverage)
  - `TaskMapper.ts`: 30.00% (needs improvement)
  - Models: 54.55% (moderate coverage)

---

## Test Doubles Implementation

- **Mocks**: Used in `TaskFacade` tests for database operations
- **Stubs**: Implemented for task creation scenarios
- **Spies**: Used for monitoring task state changes
- **Fakes**: Employed for database testing

---

## Quality Assurance Approach

### Verification

- Unit tests verify individual components
- Integration tests verify component interactions
- Specification tests verify business rules

### Validation

- User acceptance criteria verification
- Business requirement alignment
- End-to-end functionality testing

## Reflection and Discussion

### Overview

Throughout this project, I've focused on building a comprehensive testing strategy that ensures both code quality and user satisfaction. The combination of different testing approaches has given me valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of our implementation.

### Key Insights

Working with TypeScript and MongoDB presented unique challenges, particularly in handling asynchronous operations and database interactions. The mutation testing results (24.71% overall) highlighted areas needing improvement, especially in the `TaskMapper` component. I found that while `TaskFacade` tests were quite robust (72.97% coverage), other areas of the application could benefit from more thorough testing.

### Areas for Growth

Looking back, I see several opportunities for improvement:

- Expanding `TaskMapper` test coverage
- Adding more edge case scenarios
- Implementing performance testing
- Enhancing error handling tests

## Final Thoughts

This testing implementation has taught me the value of a multi-layered testing approach. While my current test suite provides good coverage of core functionality, there's always room for improvement in terms of edge cases and error scenarios.
